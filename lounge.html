        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,which are seeds of berries from the <strong>Coffa</strong>plant

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <p>The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch <em>koffie</em>,borrowed from the <strong>OttomanTurkish</strong>
          <em>kahve</em>,in turn borrowed from the Arabic qahwah.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given by Arab lexicographers as
          deriving from the verb qahiya,"to lack  hunger" ,in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant.It has also been
          proposed that source may be ProtoCentral Semitic root q-h-h meaning "dark".

        <h3>Legendary accounts</h3>
        <p>According to legend,ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were believed to have been first to
        recoginze the energing effect of the coffee plant,through no direct evidences  has been found indicating where in Africa
        coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as stimulant or even known about it ,earlier than 17th century.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century
           in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a
            similar way to how it is now prepared.Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals.
          Accounts differ on the origin of coffee (seeds) prior to its appearance in Yemen.One account credits Muhammad ben Said for
           bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast. Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was
            the first to introduce coffee to Arabia.According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay
            with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401.Famous 16th century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings
             of a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in the Zeila region.
            </p>
          <p>By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa. The first coffee smuggled out of
            the Middle East was by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India in 1670.Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilised.
            Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore.
             Coffee then spread to Italy, and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia, and to the Americas</p>

          <div id="quote">
             <p>In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee after returning from a ten-year trip to the Near East:
    A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses, particularly those of the stomach. Its consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly,
    in a porcelain cup that is passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful.It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu.</p>

        <h3>Biology</h3>
        <p>Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially cultivated are
          Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as 'robusta') and C. arabica.[ C. arabica, the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern
          highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and possibly Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya. C. canephora is native to western and
          central Subsaharan Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan. Less popular species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C. racemosa.
          All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m  tall when unpruned. The leaves are
          dark green and glossy, usually 10–15 cm  long and 6 cm  wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at base to form interpetiolar
           stipules, characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of inferior ovary, also characteristic
          of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5 cm . When immature they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying.
            Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries have only one; these are called peaberries. Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months,
            while robusta take nine to eleven months</p>

        <h3>Cultivation</h3>
        <p>The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half
           fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often
           intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements.[45] Coffee plants grow within
           a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.</p>
